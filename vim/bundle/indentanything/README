The IndentAnything plugin is intended to make it easier to write new indentation scripts and/or supplement existing ones.  It makes the assumption that all indentable languages have similar characteristics:

	- blocks of code or text over multiple lines
	- continuation lines
	- comments

The rules of indentation are specified in a series of variables.  Explanation is provided in the included doc/IndentAnything.txt help file.

An example HTML indentation enhancement is also included.
